# Bodhi-Orthobot
AI robot for orthopedic surgery to reduce radiation exposure. Two xrays AP &amp; lateral images will be processed into 3D model for planning in realtime (IR sensors - postion feedback) - reduction manoure, trajectory of implants (MIS), the dimensions of implants, and possible solution for implant stress failure
